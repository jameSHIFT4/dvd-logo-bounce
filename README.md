# Bouncing DVD Logo

Sort of a test. Found out about marquees today and decided to try an make this look nice.

## Version 1:

Made from marquee elements. I cannot change the color of the logo without JavaScript. This version does support a dynamic aspect ratio though. That's why you can run it in fullscreen mode and even change your browser's window size while it's running.

## Version 2:

Made from CSS keyframe animations. I can change the color but I have to set and time it exactly. This version does not support a dynamic aspect ratio.
